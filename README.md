Smart IV Detection System
Overview
The Smart IV Detection System is a project developed for [insert hackathon name or event]. The goal of this project is to revolutionize patient care by automating the monitoring and replacement of IV bags in healthcare facilities.

Introduction
In traditional healthcare settings, nurses manually monitor and replace IV bags for patients. This process can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially in busy hospital environments. Our project aims to address these challenges by implementing a smart IV detection system that leverages IoT concepts, sensors, and MQTT protocols to monitor IV fluid levels in real-time. When fluid levels are low, the system automatically alerts healthcare providers, enabling timely replacement of IV bags and ensuring continuous patient care.

Features
Real-time monitoring of IV fluid levels
Automatic alerts for low fluid levels
Integration with existing healthcare infrastructure
User-friendly interface for healthcare providers
Getting Started
To get started with the Smart IV Detection System, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies using npm install.
Configure the MQTT broker settings in the application code.
Start the server using npm start.
Access the web interface to monitor IV fluid levels and receive alerts.
